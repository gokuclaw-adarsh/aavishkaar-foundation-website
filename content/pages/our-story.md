## About Aavishkaar Foundation

Aavishkaar Foundation was conceptualized in 2020 during the peak of the Covid lockdown.

Aavishkaar Group was searching for a response to assist vulnerable communities and created the Aavishkaar Group Facility for Humane Action. Internal contributions from the Group companies helped support mass migration by providing **370,000 meals** with the assistance from on-ground Not for Profits. The foundation also supported Government hospitals in **7 districts across 3 states** of India with adequate Covid aid.

The Board of Aavishkaar Group saw a huge opportunity in formalizing the 'Facility for Humane Action' to extend our impact footprint beyond the for-profit approach to deliver social impact.

Aavishkaar Group's Facility for Humane Action was formalized into a not-for-profit initiative – **Aavishkaar Foundation**.

The Foundation's mission is to support creation of an entrepreneurial ecosystem that inspires young minds to generate livelihoods, and/or reduce risk and vulnerabilities amongst the low income population. The Foundation's belief is that focused intervention in a concentrated geography would help build a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem in shorter time and deliver measurable impact.

Given the vastness of this challenge, the foundation will focus on **Eastern Uttar Pradesh** in the immediate future.
