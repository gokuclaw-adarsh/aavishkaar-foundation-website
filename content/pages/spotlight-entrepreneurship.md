## Driving Transformative Impact Regionally Through Entrepreneurship of Marginalized Youth

At Aavishkaar Foundation we believe that unleashing the bottled spirit of entrepreneurship among unemployed and marginalized youth will have transformative impact across low income regions of India and accelerate economic and social inclusion. We believe that empowered, ethical, curious and morally trained youth entrepreneurs can deliver jobs, livelihoods and impact through business intervention. They can become catalysts for change, inspiring others to participate in alleviating poverty, reducing vulnerabilities and transforming the region's income equity and prosperity. The foundation pilot intervention is directed towards Eastern Uttar Pradesh.

## Geographic Focus: Eastern Uttar Pradesh

Uttar Pradesh (UP) State lies in the middle of the Gangetic plains of India and is characterized by a large population with about **237 Million people**. The level of economic and human development in the State is low when compared to other Indian States and has been unable to accommodate the essential needs and aspirations of its rising population.

### Key Statistics
- Secondary education attainment: **27%** (one of the lowest in the country)
- Stunting in children under 5: **50%** (highest malnutrition in the country)
- Infant mortality rate: **50/1000**
- The **15 eastern districts** of the State fare poorer when compared to even the rest of the State

### Covid Migration Context
The State witnessed significant movement of migrant workers back to Uttar Pradesh as Covid brought life to a standstill. This massive influx brings experienced and skilled hands back to the State; and we believe this provides impetus for our efforts to support an entrepreneur-led development model as these men and women have worked in such ecosystems and have the potential to be perfect role models.

## Five Pronged Intervention Strategy

### ENGAGE
Inculcate entrepreneurial curiosity in young students through Business Plan competitions in Government and Rural schools around sustainable and ethical businesses and introduce them to an entrepreneurial thought process early in their journey.

### SUPPORT
Groom young adults, unemployed and/or marginalized youth on business planning, business thinking through virtual incubation, by providing mentorship and exposure trips

### CATALYZE
Mobilize risk capital through Grants, Angels, Social Venture Funds, and Zero Coupon Zero Principal Impact Bonds through the Social Stock Exchange to finance the business vision of the young entrepreneurs with limited return expectations.

### INSPIRE
Build the local ecosystem by creating a platform to showcase the entrepreneurial talent and their ideas to the world, encouraging networks of local entrepreneurs, aligning academic and government institutions to young entrepreneurs' ideas, celebrating entrepreneurship as a social revolution, and creating a deal making environment for the entrepreneurs with the right ideas. Bring vibrancy in the local ecosystem by amplifying the impact of youth entrepreneurs through media, seminars and engaging local government by bringing in international role models, new investors.

### INSTITUTIONALIZE
Bring all learnings together over time to launch an educational curriculum through a mass entrepreneurship University that would guide 1000's of curious minds towards impact entrepreneurship, transforming lives and communities.

## Partner with Us

We are working toward a 3 year plan to start with and are seeking partners who would be willing to support either all of some part of this journey as also to support us to put together a strong team to execute on the vision. Aavishkaar Foundation would receive support from Aavishkaar Group and the Aavishkaar team in general but we believe a dedicated world class team would deliver real impact on the ground faster, efficiently and transparently.
