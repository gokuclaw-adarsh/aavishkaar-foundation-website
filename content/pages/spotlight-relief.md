## To Respond to Natural Calamities by Providing Relief Interventions at the Bottom of the Pyramid

At Aavishkaar Foundation while our focus is on unleashing entrepreneurship amongst the rural youth, we also engage in relief initiatives during natural calamities. We are currently supporting **4 relief initiatives** across Bihar, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh with the aim to strengthen local communities and provide basic resources.

## Testimonials

### Cornelia Heinen
**Board Member, TotalStart**

> "Since 2012 TotalStart has been associated with the Group as a partner where Aavishkaar Capital invested in one of our incubated companies 'Nalanda Learning Systems Private Limited' and they continue to support us even today. In the 1st Covid wave, Aavishkaar Foundation supported one of our incubatees MushroomAg Private Limited (www.mushroomers.in) through direct financial support for a period of 3 months. For an enterprise run entirely by visually challenged and differently abled, this was instrumental in sustaining them through an incredibly difficult period. In the 2nd Covid wave, Aavishkaar Foundation supported www.dokraarts.com, where about 100 Underserved Dokra Artisan Families were supported with food ration. We look forward to carry on our relationship with Aavishkaar Group which is now a decade old and we are extremely honoured and privileged to have Aavishkaar Group on TotalStart's Honour Board."

> "Working on a Dream Project is something that most of us don't get to do in a lifetime. First there's this mind that tells you that it's outside your comfort zone, it's risky and the beauty of that tiny googly that makes most of us give up on our dreams – what if you fail? Then you come up with an organisation like Aavishkaar Foundation whose very ethos is steeped in encouraging the impossible and those that believe in such unlikely dreams. Aavishkaar Foundation is that essential entity that must be encouraged with every fibre of support. Because of them others can Dare to Dream."
