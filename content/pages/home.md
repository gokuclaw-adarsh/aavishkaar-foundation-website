Driving Transformative Impact Regionally Through **Entrepreneurship of Marginalized Youth**

### Body Copy
At Aavishkaar Foundation we believe that unleashing the bottled spirit of entrepreneurship among unemployed and marginalized youth will have transformative impact across low income regions of India and accelerate economic and social inclusion.

We believe that empowered, ethical, curious and morally trained youth entrepreneurs can deliver jobs, livelihoods and impact through business intervention. They can become catalysts for change, inspiring others to participate in alleviating poverty, reducing vulnerabilities and transforming the region's income equity and prosperity. The foundation pilot intervention is directed towards Eastern Uttar Pradesh.

## Monitoring, Measurement and Reporting

The objective of Aavishkaar Foundation is to create a vibrant and supportive entrepreneurial ecosystem in the marginalized states of India.

The foundation follows the Aavishkaar Impact Measurement and Monitoring Framework which includes benchmarking at the outset, a projection of the estimated impact of the intervention, and finally an annual report on actual impact outputs and outcomes.

**Report:** [Aavishkaar Group Impact Report 2020](https://aavishkaargroup.com/wp-content/uploads/Aavishkaar_Impact_Report2020.pdf) - showcases the journey of 12 bold, resilient women who embraced risks to impact their communities.

Partner with Us

We are working towards a 3 year plan to start with and are seeking partners who would be willing to support either all, or some part of this journey to support us in putting together a strong team to execute on the vision. Aavishkaar Foundation would receive support from Aavishkaar Group and the Aavishkaar team in general but we believe a dedicated world class team would deliver real impact on the ground faster, efficiently and transparently.
